During my internship, I developed a Smart Recruitment System using Streamlit to streamline the applicant tracking process. This system allows users to upload multiple PDF resumes, which are then processed and evaluated against a job description. I integrated Google Generative AI (Gemini) to analyze the resumes and provide detailed evaluations and percentage matches based on the job requirements. Key technologies used include Python, pdf2image for PDF processing, and Google Generative AI for content generation. This project enhances recruitment efficiency by automating resume assessments and providing insightful feedback
